Little Johnny has always wanted to go to Berlin. His friend, Roger, had told him about all the good food there.
Roger recommended Johnny eat the bratwurst if he ever had a chance to go.
Little Johnny rushed over to the Flughafen, his mouth watering for brats. 
However, he had made the mistake of landing in Raesfeld, 6 hours away!
Upon realizing his mistake, Little Johnny felt lost and scared, cold sweat forming on his back as the airport's Klimaanlage blasted down.
Johnny slapped himself back into focus and with determination, set out to find a ratskeller and the brats he came for.
First he would need a ride, so he went to rent a car; soon enough, he was cruising Hauptstrasse in a stylish BMW.
Johnny never felt more alive, but he needed some energy if he were to last the long trip, so he blasted some music from his favorite band Rammstein.
Around he drove, but for his hour of searching the best he could find was a small doener stand.
After he finished his doener, he craved something sweet, so he also ate an apfelkuchen, which lifted his spirits. 
Nourished and reinvigorated, Johnny adjusted his Lederhose and prepared to continue his drive.
Johnny being wettbewerbsfaehig, he set his eyes on the autobahn looking for competition in his BMW while going to Berlin.
While driving, he came across a Porche that looked ready for a race!
Johnny excitedly sped off, however he was quickly overtaken by the Porsche, to cure the sadness of his loss Johnny took a detour to the Biergarten.
He arrived at the biergarten and filled up his steinzeug krug, his herz became fuller with each drink.
