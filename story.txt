Little Johnny has always wanted to go to Berlin. His friend, Roger, had told him about all the good food there.
Roger recommended Johnny eat the bratwurst if he ever had a chance to go.
Little Johnny rushed over to the Flughafen, his mouth watering for brats. 
However, he had made the mistake of landing in Raesfeld, 6 hours away!
Upon realizing his mistake, Little Johnny felt lost and scared, cold sweat forming on his back as the airport's Klimaanlage blasted down.
Johnny slapped himself back into focus and with determination, set out to find a ratskeller and the brats he came for.
